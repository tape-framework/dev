`tape.dev`

=== About

A Swiss-Army Knife of deps and tools for development and testing Tape Framework
modules.

=== Install

Add it to your `:dev` or `:test` alias deps.

.deps.edn
[source,clojure]
----
{:aliases {:test {:extra-paths ["test" "target"]
                  :extra-deps {tape/dev {:local/root "../dev"}}}}}
----

=== Usage

==== Build

In a a Clojure REPL, start:

- `(build/pig)` CLJS REPL with piggieback.
- `(build/fig)` Figwheel with a build based on project-level dev.cljs.edn file.
- `(build/big)` as above, with piggieback
- `(build/auto m)` a build based on configuration discovered automatically;
  the map `m` is a an optional map of overrides like `{:main 'my.core}`.

Note: for piggieback: use a Clojure https://nrepl.org/[nREPL] with
https://github.com/nrepl/piggieback[piggieback] middleware.

==== Serve WebJars assets

Serving WebJars assets is useful in DevCards. To do it add the following entry
in your config (for figwheel is in the meta part of edn config):

.dev.cljs.edn
[source,clojure]
----
^{:ring-handler tape.dev.server/handler}
{:main my.core}
----

The `tape.tools.server/app` handler uses middleware that serves static
resources from `"/META-INF/resources/webjars"`, so assets can be linked as:

.hiccup
[source,clojure]
----
[:link {:rel "stylesheet" :href "/webjars/bulma/0.8.0/css/bulma.min.css"}]
----

=== Deps pulled in

This pulls in https://github.com/day8/re-frame-10x[re-frame-10x] and
https://github.com/jgthms/bulma[Bulma WebJar] for use in development and
DevCards.
